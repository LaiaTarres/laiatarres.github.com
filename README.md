# Laia's website
This repository is my first try at creating my personal webpage. My idea is to update whatever I am doing professionally, and it will help as a motivator for my PhD. 

Things that I have to do: 
- Update the skills
- Update resume and add it to the "download resume" button
- Update work experience
- Create a timeline with latest works: 
  - The CVPR social event that I helped organize
  - Presenting TFM at last year's symposium
  - Teaching in Dublin + ACL
  - The poster presentation at CVPR22
  - Submission to the challenge.
